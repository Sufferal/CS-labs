## Caesar Cipher (#1)
It is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security.

## Mono-alphabetic Cipher (#2)
A mono-alphabetic cipher is a type of substitution cipher in cryptography where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a single, fixed letter in the ciphertext.
In a mono-alphabetic cipher, the substitution remains consistent throughout the entire message, making it relatively easy to decipher through frequency analysis and other cryptanalysis techniques.

While mono-alphabetic ciphers are straightforward to implement, they are not secure for protecting sensitive information because they are vulnerable to simple cryptanalysis methods.
